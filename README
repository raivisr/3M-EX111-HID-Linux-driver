Driver for 3M EX111 HID touchscreen identified by vendor id - 0596 and product id - 0003.

Just copy to your /usr/src and run make (assuming you have kernel headers and build tools like gcc
in place). If there are no errors, run make install and this driver will be installed in directory
for extra modules.

I didn't find a way to make an out of tree hid driver, so I made it usb driver, but if anyone
wants to push it to kernel tree more appropriate location is probably drivers/hid/
